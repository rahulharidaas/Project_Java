Class , Object & Methods 
--------------------------

-> Structural programming
-> Object oriented programming 

Definition
------------
Class is a logical entity , where as an object is a physical entity.
An object is an instance of a class.
so to create an object , we need to creata a class. A class cannot be used directly , we need to create an object inorder to use a class.

Eg: lets take an example of employees, where number of employees will have different info like id  , name and deparment etc.

All these data is called as a class.

- A class is collection of variables and methods 
- Object is an instance of class 
- method is a piece of code which will perform some task 
Methods should be part of class

How to declare a class?
-------------------------

Class 
{

variables 
Methods 

}

Create object for the class 
-------------------------------

Employee emp = new employee();

Here is Employee is a class 
emp-->is the variable of object 
employee() --> Instantiation


syntax of Metod 
-----------------------

m1()
{
// code 
}

some methods will return some values some won't based on the logic.
If the method is not returing any values, user has to mention to " void" along with the method.

Void m1()
{
//code 

}

if the method is returning some values , the user has to mention the data type of the  data which is been returned.

int m1()
{
//code 
//return l --> here l will be an integer value which will be returned 
}

Note : the data returned  and the data type should be the same data type 
for exmaple if the return value is integer type , then the user shoudl mention the "int" at the method initiation.
