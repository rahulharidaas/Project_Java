Class , Object & Methods 
--------------------------

-> Structural programming
-> Object oriented programming 

Definition
------------
Class is a logical entity , where as an object is a physical entity.
Class is a collection of objects.
Eg.Under vehicles class there are Car , bus and bike so on.
An object is an instance of a class.( which means a subset of class) 
so to create an object , we need to create a class. A class cannot be used directly , we need to create an object inorder to use a class.

Eg: lets take an example of employees, where number of employees will have different info like id  , name and deparment etc.

All these data is called as a class.

- A class is collection of variables and methods 
- Object is an instance of class 
- method is a piece of code which will perform some task 
Methods should be part of class, method will do some activities.

How to declare a class?
-------------------------

Class  Employee 
{

variables 
Methods 

}

Create object for the class 
-------------------------------

Employee emp = new employee();

Here  Employee--> is a class 
emp-->is the variable of object name 
new employee() --> Instantiation( without this it will not allocate memory ) 


syntax of Method 
-----------------------

m1()
{
// code 
}

some methods will return some values some won't based on the logic.
If the method is not returing any values, user has to mention to " void" along with the method.

Void m1()
{
//code 

}

if the method is returning some values , the user has to mention the data type of the  data which is been returned.

eg int m1()
{
//code
}

int m1()
{
//code 
//return l --> here l will be an integer value which will be returned 
}

Note : the data returned  and the data type should be the same data type 
for example if the return value is integer type , then the user shoudl mention the "int" at the method initiation.



                                      Methods 
                              ----------------------
                                        
                                        
                                   Types of methods 
                                        
                           How many way we can initialize the class?.
                                         
                                         
                           1.Using Object( Already done) 
                                         
                           2.USING CONSTRUCTOR
                                         
                             What is a constructor 
                             
                             Constructor is a type of method, and the constructor name should be same as class.
                             In constructor method first we will assign the class variables to a constructor 
                             method. 
                             Eg; public class Employees 
                             
                                {
                                int empid;  // These are class variables
                                String name;
                                int salary;
                                int  departmentno;
                                
                                }
                                
                                // Now we will assign these class variables to a constructor 
                                Note: A constructor name should be same as class name, here the class name i s
                                Employees so the constructor name also should be Employees 
                                
                                Employees(int id , String nam , int sal, int dept)
                                {
                                  empid = id;  // Here we have assigned the class values to the constructor method
                                  name = nam;
                                  salary=sal;
                                  departmentno = dept;
                                }
                                
                                Void display()
                                {
                                  System.out.println(empid);
                                  System.out.println(name);
                                  System.out.println(salary);
                                  System.out.println(departmentno);
                                  

                                }
                                
                                public static void main( String args[])
                                {
                                   Employees emp1= new Employees(101,"Rahul");
                                  emp.dispplay();
                                  
                                  Employees emp2 = new Employees(102,"ram");
                                
                                now after assigning the values / or creating the object will call the method.
                                emp1.display();
                                
                                this will call the method and display the values..
                                
                                
                                }
                                
                                
		 
                              
                           3.USING METHOD
                           
                           Assigning values to class variable using method.
                           
                           Steps 1
                           
                           1. Initiate the class and declare the variables
                              
                              
                              public class employees 
                              {
                              
                               int emp_id;
                               String Name;
                               int salary;
                               String department;
                               
                               
                             Step 2. Create a method and assign the  class values to the method variables
                              Here user can have different method name , no need to have the same as class name.
                              since this is a method which returns no value we can write method like this.
                              
                              void setdata(int id , String nam, int sal,String dept)
                              {
                                 emp_id = id ;
                                 Name = nam;
                                 salary = sal;
                                 department = dept;
                              }
                              
                              Step 3. Create a method for the action to be taken place
                              
                              {
                                 System.out.println("id");
                                
                                 System.out.println("nam");
                                 System.out.println("sal");
                                 System.out.println("dept);
                                 
                              
                              }
                              
                              
                              Step 4 . To access the class we need to create objects
                              
                             which we will be doing it on main method 
                             
                             public static void main ( String args[])
                             
                             
                             {
                             // Unlike object and constructor method , here we will call the method with variables.
                                employee emp1= new employees();
                                emp1.setdata(101,"ram", 50000, "dept");
                                emp1.display();
                             }
                             
                               
                              
                              }
                              
                              
                              
                              
                              Types of Methods 
                              
                              There are 4 scenarios 
                              
                             
                              
                              
                              1.A method  may not take parameters
                              
                                public class calculation
                                {
                                  int a; // Declaring the variables 
                                  int b ;
                                  
                                  
                                  void sum()
                                  {
                                    system.out.println(a+b)
                                  }
                                  
                                
                                
                                public static void main(String args[]) 
                                
                               {
                                calculation cal= new calculation();// Creating objects to access the class 
                                
                                cal.a=100;
                                cal.b=200;
                                cal.sum();// calling the method 
                               }
                               }
                              
                              2.A method  take parameters.
                              
                              3.A  Method may  return.
                              
                              4.A Method does not  return values.
